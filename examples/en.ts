            question: "What is iara.?",
            answer: "iara. is an application that allows beauty professionals to easily manage their business through various features offered, and clients to search for providers nearby and book in just a few clicks. We've combined the booking platform with a social network: you can find a feed of inspiration and the ability to post photos to showcase your work or recommend your best addresses as a client. You can also access the catalog referencing more than +400 treatments."
          },
          2: {
            question: "How to get started on iara?",
            answer: "You can start on iara simply and independently: just download the app from the AppStore or PlayStore and follow the account creation steps. Whether you're a client or professional, everything is explained!"
          },
          3: {
            question: "Can I use iara in other countries?",
            answer: "The application is already available in 17 countries: Germany, Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, United Arab Emirates, United States, Finland, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, Norway, New Zealand, Netherlands, United Kingdom, Sweden & Switzerland."
          },
          4: {
            question: "Is the app really free?",
            answer: "Yes! The free plan allows you to manage your business through online appointment booking, your schedule, your client file, your personalized profile and your mini dashboard. There are no limits on bookings, treatments offered or clients. You'll also have access to social features: the feed, catalog and photo posting. We also offer several plans with more features."
          },
          5: {
            question: "Do I have to pay commissions in addition to the iara plan?",
            answer: "No, there are no additional commissions. During an online payment, a commission from Stripe, the secure payment platform, is however applied on the client side to guarantee them dispute management and refunds if necessary."
          },
          6: {
            question: "Do I need to download two applications if I'm both a professional and a client?",
            answer: "No, we offer one application for everyone! Like on Instagram, you can easily switch between your two accounts by long-pressing on your profile picture."
          },
          7: {
            question: "Is my profile visible to all users?",
            answer: "Yes, your profile will be visible to all users as soon as your profile is complete. Don't hesitate to block booking if you're not ready yet!"
          },
          8: {
            question: "How to post photos on iara?",
            answer: "Whether you're a client or professional, you can post photos directly from the feed by clicking the \"+\" button in the top right."
          },
          9: {
            question: "Are my photos visible to all users?",
            answer: "Yes! Each posted photo appears in the feed, on your profile, and in the catalog if you've tagged one or more treatments."

            question: "How to make an appointment?",
            answer: "It's super simple: just access a provider's profile, via their booking link or by searching for them, then click the \"Book\" button. The professional may require a deposit when booking."
          },
          2: {
            question: "Do I necessarily have to download the app to make an appointment?",

          },
          3: {
            question: "How to manage my appointments?",
            answer: "You can easily find all your appointments in the \"My appointments\" section. You can directly modify or cancel your upcoming appointments if you're still within the time limit allowed by the professional. You can also leave them a review once the appointment is finished."
          },
          4: {
            question: "When is the exact address communicated to me?",
            answer: "The exact address will be displayed directly on the summary 24 hours before the appointment, on the app or on the web. You'll also receive a reminder email with all the necessary details."
          },
          5: {
            question: "Is the deposit refunded to me in case of cancellation?",
            answer: "If the cancellation takes place within the time limits allowed by the professional, the deposit will be automatically refunded. It will appear on your account within 2 to 7 business days. If the cancellation takes place outside the allowed time limits, you will lose your deposit."

            question: "How to access appointments made by my clients?",
            answer: "As a professional, all your appointments are accessible from the \"Schedule\" tab. You can also follow recent activity in the \"Updates\" tab, in the top right of your schedule. You'll find new appointments, modifications and cancellations there."
          },
          2: {
            question: "How to manually add an appointment as a professional?",
            answer: "You can add an appointment manually by clicking on the small \"+\" in the top right of your schedule. You can then select the client, the treatment(s), the date, the appointment time and adjust the duration if necessary. You can also create an appointment for a client who doesn't have an iara account yet â just remember to enter their contact details so they receive reminders!"
          },
          3: {
            question: "Do my clients receive appointment reminders?",
            answer: "Yes, each client receives an email and notification when booking, as well as a reminder 24 hours before the appointment. You can also activate SMS reminders included in the Mini and Lite+ plans."
          },
          4: {
            question: "How can my clients leave a review?",
            answer: "Following an appointment, clients receive an email and notification inviting them to leave you a review. They can also do so from the \"My appointments\" tab directly on the app or from the web."
          },
          5: {
            question: "Can I add personal appointments to my schedule?",
            answer: "Very soon! This feature is in development and will allow you to block slots for your personal unavailability."
          },
          6: {
            question: "How to manage my availability as a professional?",
            answer: "You can add availability from your profile > Manage my business > My opening hours. The hours entered correspond to opening and closing hours - not the time of the last appointment. You can add recurrence on the days of your choice for simplicity. To add a break, you'll just need to create two time slots: for example from 10am-1pm and 2pm-7pm."
          },
          7: {
            question: "How can I add vacations or days off?",
            answer: "To make yourself unavailable, just delete your hours on the days you don't want to be available by clicking \"Delete this day\"."
          },
          8: {
            question: "Why don't my clients see my availability?",
            answer: "Don't worry, this can be due to several reasons: You may not have entered enough days in the \"Booking policy > Advance bookings\" section. If you enter 15 days there, your clients can only book 15 days before the appointment date. You may have entered too many days in the \"Booking policy > Late bookings\" section. The total duration of the selected treatment(s) may be longer than the duration of your slots. The slot therefore cannot be offered for booking."
          },
          9: {
            question: "What does the \"Booking policy\" section correspond to?",
            answer: "Your booking policy allows you to customize booking conditions, such as deadlines for booking, rescheduling or cancelling an appointment. If a client cancels outside the deadline, their deposit will be lost. You can also adapt these conditions for certain clients by designating them as loyal customers."
          },
          10: {
            question: "Can I customize my booking policy for some of my clients?",
            answer: "Yes, you can absolutely customize your booking conditions for some of your clients by selecting them as loyal customers, directly from the \"My clients\" tab. You can, for example, give them early access to your schedule, allow them to book without a deposit or even cancel at the last minute."
          },
          11: {
            question: "How to manage the display of slots to my clients?",
            answer: "On iara, you can choose the slots displayed to your clients from \"My booking policy > \"Show slots every\". You have the option to offer slots every 5 minutes, 15 minutes, 1 hour, 2 hours, or even 4 hours, depending on what suits you best. For example, if your hours are 10am to 6pm and you select showing slots every 2 hours, your clients will see the following slots: 10am, 12pm, 2pm and 4pm."
          },
          12: {
            question: "How to avoid dead hours?",
            answer: "Just activate the \"Automatic slot creation\" feature! This allows you to optimize your slots to avoid \"dead time\" by creating new slots for your clients as soon as your initial slots are booked. For example, if the slots offered to my clients are 10am, 12pm, 2pm or 4pm, and a client books a 30-minute service at 10am, a slot will automatically be added at 10:30am to avoid an empty interval from 10:30am to 12pm."
          },
          13: {
            question: "How to synchronize my schedule to my iCal or Google Calendar?",
            answer: "You can simply synchronize your schedule from \"My profile\" > \"Manage my business\" > \"Synchronize my schedule\". You'll find your synchronization link there. Just click on it to add it to your iCal or Google Calendar, which must be done from a computer. Everything is explained in the application, but don't hesitate to contact us if you need help!"

            question: "What does the iara wallet correspond to?",
            answer: "The iara wallet is a virtual wallet into which your earnings are paid: deposits, online payments, referral earnings... You can then transfer the money to your bank account by transfer."
          },
          2: {
            question: "What payment methods are accepted on iara?",
            answer: "Clients will be able to pay on the application via ApplePay or bank card. On the web, they will also be able to pay with BanContact, Twint and Klarna."
          },
          3: {
            question: "How to activate deposits on iara?",
            answer: "You can activate deposits from \"My profile\" > \"Manage my business\" > \"Payment methods\". Once the option is activated, you can define the desired amount(s). Deposits will be available in your wallet once the appointment is finished. This feature is available in the Lite and Lite+ plans."
          },
          4: {
            question: "Can I activate deposits without activating full online payments?",
            answer: "Yes, you can choose not to authorize full payment on the application. The remaining balance will therefore be settled on site."
          },
          5: {
            question: "What happens if a client cancels an appointment and a deposit has been paid?",
            answer: "If the cancellation takes place within the deadlines provided by your booking policy, the deposit is automatically refunded to the client. If the cancellation takes place outside the deadlines, the deposit will be paid directly to your wallet."
          },
          6: {
            question: "Why are my earnings \"pending\"?",
            answer: "During an online payment, amounts are first displayed as \"pending\" until the end of the appointment. They then become \"available\" and you can transfer them to your bank account with a few clicks. If your earnings remain pending, it's perhaps because your Stripe account is not yet validated. In this case, remember to provide the requested information (ID, IBAN...) to unlock access. Regarding referral earnings, they will be unlocked as soon as the professional you referred subscribes to a plan."
          },
          7: {
            question: "How to recover my earnings?",
            answer: "To transfer the money available in your wallet, just validate your Stripe account. During your first transfer, you'll need to enter some information: ID and IBAN. Once your account is verified, you can send your earnings to your bank account with a few clicks. The transfer will appear on your account within 2 to 7 business days."
          },
          8: {
            question: "Why hasn't my Stripe account been validated?",
            answer: "Don't panic! This may come from poor reading of your identity documents. Don't hesitate to contact our customer service."
          },
          9: {
            question: "What is buyer protection on iara?",
            answer: "These are the fees imposed by the Stripe secure payment platform. In addition to ensuring the security of each transaction, these fees help ensure refund and dispute management if necessary."

          2: {
            question: "Is it possible to merge clients?",

There are no limits on bookings, services offered, or clients. You'll also have access to social features: the feed, catalog, and photo publishing. We also offer several plans with additional features."

        6: {
          question: "How do I withdraw my earnings?",
          answer: "Earnings are available once an appointment is completed. To transfer the money available in your wallet, you simply need to validate your Stripe account. For this, you'll need to provide an ID and IBAN. Your account is usually verified within a few hours - don't hesitate to contact us if this isn't the case. Once your account is validated, you can send your earnings to your bank account with a few clicks and the transfer will appear in your account within 2 to 7 business days."
